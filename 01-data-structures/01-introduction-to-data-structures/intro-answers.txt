1. The structure for the line is an array. Accessing the information within it
will require the same programmatic interactions as would manipulating an array
within whatever language the developer is using.

The second structure is to arrays set up in parallel to one another.
Again, any interactions with the information require use of array methods.
A limitation in this case is that if the developer adds or deletes from one array,
the other must also be altered in kind or the data structure will no longer reflect
the information is has been built to represent.

2. Searching through the arrays would involve looping through the data and using
a conditional statement to find a match.From there, one would consult the corresponding
array's index to collect all of the information needed.

3. A set of user names and passwords could be set up into parallel arrays. Movies
and their play time or an item-price database for a store would also work.
